In this post, we will discuss Einstein's famous equation \( E = mc^2 \). The equation states that energy is equal to mass times the speed of light squared.

For a particle at rest, its energy is given by:

$$
E_0 = m_0 c^2
$$

Where:
- \( E_0 \) is the rest energy,
- \( m_0 \) is the rest mass,
- \( c \) is the speed of light.

Another interesting formula is the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \), which is defined as:

$$
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
$$
