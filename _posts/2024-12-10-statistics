> *Statistics is the forefront of science. It helps people of different fields make informed decisions. It serves the same purpose in risk management.
Statistics can help companies quantify the probability of going insolvent. Statistics plays a big part in informing the likelihood of some amount 
of claims being made. Shortly speaking, statistics is the foundation for lots of concepts in risk management. Therefore, I am dedicating this post 
to exploring the basic statistical concepts to refresh your memory.*

# Distributions in Statistics

## Random Variable and Distribution

In your elementary statistics classes, we have come across the random variable. A random variable (notation capital $X$, capital $Y$, etc.) can be seen as a random realisations (small $x$, small $y$) of something measurable. 
For example, the time needed to travel from A to B or the weight of chickens. Statistics tells us that such random variable has a distribution that tells us how random realisations of the random variable is spread. 
Of course we should remember there will certainly be cases where realisations can be <em style="font-style:bold;">discrete</em> or <em style="font-style:bold;">continuous</em>. A discrete realisation can be number of claims per interval, while a continuous realisation can be something as time taken to travel. We definitely cant say that one has made 34.56 claims. On the other hand, 34.56 minutes does still make sense.
Distributions can be described by this set of default matrics that is the mean and variance. The mean tells us the average values of the random realisations, while the variance tells us the spread of such random realisations from the mean. However, we will come to see that not all distributions directly have these parameters. 

A very common continuous distribution out there is the Normal Distribution. The Normal distribution tells us directly that some random variable is distributed with some arbitrary mean $\mu$ and some arbitrary standard deviation $\sigma$. A common discrete distribution is the Poisson distribution that has a lambda parameter. The lambda parameter tells us the expected rate of which an event (that is Poisson distributed) occurs at some fixed interval. In this case we are not explicitly given the mean and variance, but the mean and variance can be found using the $\lambda$. Lambda of $5$ essentially tells us that the average of the different realisations of the Poisson distributed random variable will be 5.

Every random variable that has a distribution will have these probability metrics: the probability density function (pdf), the cumulative distribution function (cdf), and the quantile function.

In R, distributions are given different codes. These codes are imperative in order to execute R functions of the pdf, cdf, and the quantile. For instance, a Poisson distribution is noted as <em style="font-style:bold;">pois</em> in R. The Normal distribution is noted as <em style="font-style:bold;">norm</em> in R. To know more about the distribution codes in R, execute the command <em style="font-style:bold;">?distribution</em>.


## Probability Density Function (pdf)

The probability density function (pdf) is a function that gives us the probability mass of some realisation $X=x$ happening.

$$ 
P[X=x] = pdf(x)
$$

In Rstudio, the function to find the density function is d<<distributioncode>>. It can be dnorm, dpois, et cetera.

```{r}
# Find probability of a realization of 8 in a Poisson distribution with lambda 5
dpois(8, lambda=5)

```
 
## Cumulative Distribution Function (cdf)

The cumulative distribution function is the function that gives us the probability mass of being less than some realization $X<x$.

$$
P[X < x] = cdf(x)
$$

In Rstudio, the function to find the density function is d<<distributioncode>>. It can be pnorm, ppois, et cetera.

```{r}
# Find probability of that a realization is less than 8 in a Poisson distribution with lambda 5
ppois(8, lambda=5)

```

## Quantile Function
