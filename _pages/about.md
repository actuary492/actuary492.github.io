      I am Nicholas Wijaya, a recent graduate in Actuarial Science, with a strong passion for risk management and data-driven work. After my studies, I wanted to upgrade myself further, and explore further what Actuarial Science has to offer. So I thought why not go back to the basics and start from there?

      The purpose of this blog is to record my learning journey, and share what I have learned on the way to aspiring actuaries. My future posts can vary from explaining actuarial topics to presenting findings on individual projects that I have conducted myself in the realm of risk management. The articles can be long, so don't expect it to be an easy read. After all, learning should be challenging and fun at the same time!

      I hope everyone who comes across this site will find my posts helpful, and of course, feedbacks are highly appreciated!
